This is our football search engine 
Due to the limitation of github, we can not add all of the preprocessed file here since it only allow 1000 entries so in order to run the project, you will have to go into the zip folder and run the main.cpp file to output the final_players.csv file.
After that, you will have to run the name.py file to get the tree_structure file and all of the resouce file in json.
That is all you need for the preprocessing for the data in this project! 
After we get the tree structure and all of the batches.json file, whenever a player name is invoked, we will seach in the binary tree and load the batch that contain the name, after that we will use the search function inmplemented in our hashmap data structure to get the correct players.
